// todo: if refactor this to use one dimensional array, then it will speed up the search, probably twice faster. But it will be less readable, and in case of you need extend something, it can require big refactoring. So, for now, leave it as is.
/// the first cell center is bottom left,
/// if we look at the level from positive z axis position
/// 
/// So incrementation happens dx positive to right
/// dy positive to up.
/// This means dy in array is reversed vs natural look.
/// First element row is bottom in model view
/// 
/// 0 - empty, able to move there
/// 1 - wall, can not move there
/// 2 - spawn area, can spawn there, can not move there
